# taskManagerExpress

Creating a task manager express application using Node.js involves building a RESTful API to handle tasks with functionalities like CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). 

# Setup Your Project 
- Initialize a new Node.js project using npm or yarn.
- Install necessary dependencies like Express.js for creating the server and handling HTTP requests.

# Create the server 
- Set up an Express server to handle HTTP requests.
- Listen on a specific port (e.g., 3000).

# Define Routes
    
    - Define routes for handling different CRUD operations on tasks.
    - For example:
        - `GET /tasks` to fetch all tasks.
        - `GET /tasks/:id` to fetch a specific task by ID.
        - `POST /tasks` to create a new task.
        - `PATCH /tasks/:id` to update a task.
        - `DELETE /tasks/:id` to delete a task.

 **Implement Controllers**:
    
    - Create controller functions for each route to handle the business logic.
    - These functions will interact with your data (e.g., in-memory array or database).

    **Data Storage**:
    
    - Decide how you want to store tasks data. You can start with an in-memory array for simplicity or use a database like MongoDB, SQLite, or PostgreSQL.
    - If using a database, integrate a database driver or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library into your project.
